I'm not sure how to compile this, I just
copied from upp projects folder and that's it.







MY WHINING:
~~~~~~~
Making this project was kind of ok. I like how little
code you have to write to make a GUI. And it's all standard
C++, no ugly nonsense.

But I gotta say, the Ultimate++ idea of packages is retarded
and doesn't play nice with anything else out there at all.

I'm not sure, I didn't find this info in ultimate++ help,
but WHY CAN'T I BUILD THIS PROJECT STANDALONE WITHOUT IDE
OR PACKAGE SYSTEM? It's a beautiful, short, concise standard
C++, why to punish your users by forcing them into IDE they
may or may not like?

My rating of ease of use when creating this project: 7.2

What rating could have been if I could build this project with cmake: 9.5
