This should compile as soon as you import the qt project.















MY WHINING:
~~~~~~~
This project was originally made with QtCreator.
Compiles and runs, no problem. As soon as it got copied
to this repo and reopened it stops compiling.

Qt creator can't even find it's own headers after moving project?
REALLY? I guess that's why I prefer cmake with vim -
no obscure retarded homegrown project file formats
which may or may not work depending on the retardation
level of it's developers.

Good job Qt!

My rating of ease of use when creating this project: 6.7
