This is project was made with CodeBlocks (13.12) and wxSmith plugin.

All you need to do is set TEMPLATIOUS_DIR enviroment variable and open this with CodeBlocks.









MY WHINING:
~~~~~~~
Codeblocks is OK with it's wxSmith plugin.
Mostly a smooth ride, although, I gotta say
that wxWidgets produces the ugliest code
out of the bunch. Boy, I hope I won't have
to deal with it too much by hand!

After copying this project it just opened and
was built from the first time (Yes, I'm still
bashing Qt)

My rating of ease of use when creating this project: 7.9
